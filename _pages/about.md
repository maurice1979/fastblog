My name is Jordi Vidal de Llobatera, I hold a degree in Physical Sciences and a Master in Energy Engineering. Most of my professional career has been in the Renewable Energy industry, for more than 10 years. Initially as a wind energy consultant, then as Data Scientist of the company where I currently work. In the last 7 years most of the tasks developed have required Machine Learning techniques. I am a passionate about Machine Learning and different data analysis techniques, and I constantly seek to improve my skills. I share the passion for Machine Learning with Renewable Energies.
 
I have experience in programming (Python, Matlab, Shell scripting) and in Linux/Windows OS. I have knowledge of SQL databases and also NoSQL (MongoDB).
